#RefugeeRobot

A simple VBA chatbot.

Gould ported it to Python because someone wanted it to run on a server and he's not masochistic enough to try and do HTTP requests in VBA from scratch. (Yet...)

Also added a web frontend because he's procrastinating doing something else. He hasn't tested it at all.
